/*!
 * @mainpage Astronomy Class Library (ACL).
 * @section Introduction
 * The Astronomy Class Library implements a number of classes that have been developed to support astronomy applications.
 * This includes support for image manipulation and data extraction, as well as classes that support astronomical calculations.<br>
 * The library is written in C++14.<br>
 * The library is written as an operating system independent library.
 *
 * @section Dependencies
 * The following open source libraries are required by the Astronomy Class library.
 * @arg SOFA <a href="http://www.iausofa.org">Standards of Fundamental Astronomy</a>
 * @arg CFitsIO <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html">A FITS File Subroutine Library</a>
 * @arg Boost Library <a href="http//www.boost.org">Boost C++ Libraries</a>
 * @arg GCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">General Class Library</a>
 * @arg MCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">Maths Class Library</a>
 * @arg PCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">Physics Class Library</a>
 * @arg SCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">Storage Class Library</a>
 *
 * @section Compilation Control
 * The following macros control how the code will be compiled for various applications.
 * @li @b ACL_NOBOOST - Do not use the Boost C++ libraries. This should only be used on platforms where the Boost C++ libraries are not
 * 								      supported. By default the Boost C++ libraries are enabled.
 * @li @b ACL_NOMT - Do not use multi-threading. This should only be used on platforms where multi-threading is not available. By
 *									 default, multi-threading support is enabled.
 * @li @b ACL_REALTIME - Compile in the realtime library support. By default this will not be compiled in.
 * @li @b ACL_NOSTRINGS - Compile without using strings. This is intended to be used for embedded applications.
 * @li @b EMBEDDED - Compile the library for embedded applications.
 * @li @b ACL_CONTROL - Compile the library for control type applications.
 *
 * @section Projects
 * The Astronomy Class Library is used as the Astronomy Library by the following projects.
 * @li Astronomical Image Reduction and Data Analysis Software.  (<a href="http://www.astroManager.net">astroManager</a>)
 * @li The Robotic Observatory Project (<a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic Observatory</a>)
 *
 * @section Development
 * The library is still under active development and is being expanded and improved along with the development of the astroManager
 * application.
 * @par Note
 * The classes within this library have been in development from 2005. As a result, all the code is not written using the
 * C++14 functionality. There is an opportunity to "clean" up the code by updating the code to reflect the C++14 standard.
 * All new code that is being developed is written to the C++14 standard.<br>
 * All C string functions will be phased out over time. Any new code should not include C string functions, but should rather use
 * the C++ std::string classes.
 * @par Reporting Bugs
 * Bugs are tracked on the bugzilla database used by <a href="https://bugzilla.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic
 * Observatory project.</a>. The bugs should be entered against the ACL project.
 * @par Source Code
 * The source code can be downloaded as a zipped file from the <a href="https://bugzilla.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic
 * Observatory project.</a>.<br>
 * The source code is also included in the source package for the <a href="http://www.astroManager.net">astroManager Project</a>. Where it
 * can be downloaded from the project site, or from the project site on Launchpad.
